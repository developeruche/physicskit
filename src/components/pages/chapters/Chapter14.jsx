    chapterSlide: [`Fundamental quantities are quantites that do not depend on other quantities e.g. mass(kg), length(m), time(s), temperature(k), electric current(ampere A), amount of substance(mol)
    luminous intensity (candela ‘Cd’).
    Derived quantities; are quantities derived from other quantities e.g. speed(m/s), acceleration (m/ ) ,density (kg ), moment (Nm), pressure (N ), torque e.t.c.
    Dimension: getting dimension is very easy, in exam you might be asked to find the dimension of an uncommon formular, note that the dimension for mass is L, distance is L, time is T, current is I, in getting dimension you need to know the formular first
    ex. 1; Find the dimension of velocity.SOLUTION
    v= = = .
    ex. 2; what is the dimension for acceleration
    SOLUTION
    a= = = .
    Ex. 3; what is the dimension for pressure?
    SOLUTION
    P= = = = . Dimension of l and b are ‘’L’’. Hence simply knowing the basic acceleration like velocity ,acceleration
    , pressure , volume .
    you can easily get other higher dimension easily ,other examples of dimension are moment , impulse , momentum , elastic modulus , you can try deriving them using their formulars.
    application of dimension; It is useful in in checking if an equation which has been derived is dimensionally correct, note that for`,
